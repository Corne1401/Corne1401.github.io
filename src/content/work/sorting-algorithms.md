# Project Description

For this project I worked on a project that utilized my skills in front-end development and challenged me to think critically about complex algorithms. The project involved building a React application that visualizes sorting algorithms, which allowed me to explore React's capabilities and develop my problem-solving skills.

The primary objectives of this project were to create a React application that utilized React hooks and managed states without relying on external libraries. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how React manages state and how to utilize hooks to manage application logic. Additionally, by building the application in a component-based manner, I ensured that the application was scalable and easy to modify as needed.

The application itself utilized various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort, among others. By visualizing the performance of these algorithms, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how they work and their relative strengths and weaknesses. This was an invaluable experience that allowed me to improve my problem-solving skills and gain experience in implementing complex algorithms within a modern web development framework.

Overall, this project is an excellent example of my ability to develop complex web applications using modern frameworks and technologies. It also demonstrates my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest web development practices and trends and my ability to think critically and problem-solve. I am proud to include this project in my portfolio and look forward to continuing to develop my skills in front-end development and software engineering.
