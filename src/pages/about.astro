				<div class="content">
					<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Cornejo, a passionate computer engineering student from Costa Rica. My love for programming and technology has been a driving force in my life since I was a child. I was always fascinated by how technology worked and how it could be used to solve problems and make our lives easier.</p>

					<p>During my highschool years, I participated in several science fairs, where I designed and built projects using the latest technologies. Some projects were successful, while others were not, but I always learned something new from every experience. These science fairs gave me the opportunity to hone my technical and problem-solving skills and sparked my interest in pursuing a career in computer engineering.</p>
					
					<p>In college, I have continued to pursue my passion for technology and programming. I have completed several projects, where I have worked with different programming languages and technologies such as Python, C++, and Java</p>
					
					<p>As a hardworking and dedicated student, I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies to improve my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. I believe that my passion for technology, combined with my strong technical and problem-solving skills, will make me an asset to any organization looking for a talented and enthusiastic computer engineer.</p>
